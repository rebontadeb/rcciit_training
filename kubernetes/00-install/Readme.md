# INSTALL KUBERNETES USING KUBEADM

## Pre-Requisites
1. Compatible Linux host(s).
2. First identify how many Leader nodes and How many Follower nodes are to be deployed.
3. Ensure you are having `root` user access for these nodes.
4. Ensure you are having internet access from these nodes.
5. 2 GB or more of RAM per machine and 2 CPUs or more. (any less will leave little room for your apps).
7. Unique hostname, MAC address, and product_uuid for every node.
8. Certain [ports](#Ports Need to be available by default.) are open on your machines.
9. Swap disabled. You MUST disable swap in order for the kubelet to work properly.

## Ports Need to be available by default.
